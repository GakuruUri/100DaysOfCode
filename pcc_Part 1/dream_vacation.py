Dream Vacation: Write a program that polls users about their dream vacation.
Write a prompt similar to If you could visit one place in the world, where
would you go? Include a block of code that prints the results of the poll.

This code will keep polling users about their dream vacation until thereâ€™s no one else to respond. After the polling is complete, it will print the results. Please note that this code needs to be run in an environment where input() function can be used, such as a Python shell or a Jupyter notebook. Enjoy your polling!
