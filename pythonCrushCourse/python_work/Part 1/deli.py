Using the list sandwich_orders from Exercise 7-8, make sure
the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times. Add code
near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has
run out of pastrami, and then use a while loop to remove all occurrences of
'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up
in finished_sandwiches.

This code will first remove all â€˜pastramiâ€™ sandwiches from the sandwich_orders list, and then it will make each of the remaining sandwiches. It will print a list of all sandwiches that were made, and you will see that no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches. Enjoy your meal!
